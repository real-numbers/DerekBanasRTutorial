Numbers in the notebook titles point to the time stamps in the video comments.

I installed Jupyter Notebook with conda, using the instructions here:

And then I created and activated a conda environment and installed the R kernal using the instructions here:

NOTE:  I haven't been 100% true to Derek's video - I've had a little fun changing things and trying this and that as I went along.  

But everything is here, and thanks for all of this should go to Derek.  I hope you will subscribe to his YouTube channel and

give his great videos some thumbs up.
